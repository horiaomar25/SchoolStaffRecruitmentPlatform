Setting up JWT

1. Create JWTUtil class to deal with generating, validating and parsing tokens.
2. Define a DTO class(JWTResponse) that encapsulates the tokens generated by the server.
3. Define DTO to handle capturing login details (LoginRequest). I also set up a RegisterRequest to deal with registering a user.
4. Make Entity is set up to hold user login in DB (AppUser).
5. Create Repository file to interact with user data using built in or custom methods to deal with the user data.
6. Create a service layer that handles the data from the methods from repo layer.
7. Make use of Spring Security UserDetails interface to encapsulate user details required for authentication.
    It comes with a number of methods that allow you to expand on the authentication such as roles if needed.
    It loads user details from the database and provides them to the authentication manager to verify the user's credentials.
8. Configure settings for Security in JWTConfig
